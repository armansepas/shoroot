- we are building a very simple betting application .
- the app should be scalable and readable so for each component we make a new file and put it in the right folder .
- the structures are
  - component (folder)
    - name of the component (folder )
      - component1.tsx
      - component2.tsx
      - utils.ts
      - index.ts
- the index is where the components are used
- the app uses next 15 , react 19 and tailwindcss as its core .
- the app is a standalone app , so we need to make a server and a client . using next js for the server and react for the client .
- we should use drizzle to connect to the neon postgresql database .
- since we are building code first database , we need to make a migration file for each change in the database .
- have a migration generator and migration push script .
  -always use tailwindcss no matter what .
- there is an md file for each component . in agent folder .
- there is a .env file for the env variables .
- state management are all done using zustand . all stated are global states by default unless specified . and all actions are global actions by default unless specified .
